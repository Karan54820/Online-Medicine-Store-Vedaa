# Online-Medicine-Store-Vedaa

Project Scope:
The healthcare industry has experienced a dramatic transformation with the
advent of technology, particularly in the field of pharmacy retail. With an
increasing demand for convenient and efficient access to prescription
medications, there is a significant need for an online pharmacy retail store.The
problems are exacerbated by
the poor management in pharmacies related to the availability of medicines and
user
data. We aim to provide a solution to this problem by designing an efficient
database
management system that provides an effective means to register a particular
patient/user into the store and also keeps a record of the availability of
medicines.
This project aims to develop an online platform that facilitates the easy purchase
and delivery of prescription drugs, ensuring accessibility and efficiency for
customers.
Objectives:
● Seamless Platform: Develop an interactive website and mobile app for
users to browse medicines, upload prescriptions, and manage orders
effortlessly.
● Robust Database: Implement a secure database to store user
information, prescription details, and real-time medicine inventory,
guaranteeing data privacy.
● Prescription Verification: Integrate a system to verify uploaded
prescriptions, ensuring medication safety and compliance with regulations.
● Automated Inventory Management: Track medicine availability in
real-time and alert users and administrators about stock levels to optimize
logistics.
● Reliable Delivery: Establish a network of qualified delivery partners for
fast and efficient medication delivery to customers' doorsteps.

Scope:
● Platform Design: Develop a user-centric web and mobile app with
functionalities like user registration, secure login, prescription upload,
medicine search, and secure payment options.
● Data Integration: Integrate a robust database with secure data encryption
to protect user information, medical records, and transaction history.
● Smart Inventory Management: Implement an automated system that
tracks stock levels, sends low-stock alerts, and updates availability
information in real-time.
● Compliance and Security: Adhere to healthcare regulations and data
protection laws. Implement robust security measures to safeguard user
information.
● Dedicated Support: Provide responsive customer support through a
helpdesk and chat options for assistance with orders, prescriptions, and
delivery tracking.

Data Stored:
The data we plan on storing would include:
● User Information: Name, contact details, email address, payment
information (securely stored), order history, and preferences.
● Delivery Partner Information: Name, contact details, driver's license,
vehicle registration, and delivery history.
● Vendor Information: Name, contact details, GSTIN number, and purchase

Functional requirements:
● User registration:

personal information.

using their email and password.
● Medicines available:
Each medicine would have a unique ID along with name and
stock available (updated regularly)

● Prescription:
It allows tracking medicines that need to be administered to the
patient as a group and for a timespan.
● Payments:
Once the prescription has been confirmed, a patient would be
provided a payment id to keep payments synchronized.
● Rating and Review:
After the ride is completed, the user will be prompted to rate and review
the
driver.
● Viewing past bookings:
The user will be able to view their past bookings on their profile page.
